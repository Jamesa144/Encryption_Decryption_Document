# Encryption_Decryption_Document
In my cybersecurity degree we learn about encryptions and for a little fun I made a program to encrypt and decrypt word documents

The program utilizes Fernet for encryption and demonstrates great performance, ensuring that the encrypted data is not easily deciphered. I appreciate the secondary option to encrypt data with a password, adding a layer of security. This feature is particularly beneficial for protecting project data, as it allows the group to share a password securely. In the event of a data breach, this extra layer would require a bad actor to overcome an additional barrier to accessing the information.

While encryption is a valuable tool, I have learned that relying solely on a single security measure is insufficient for comprehensive protection. It is essential to implement multiple layers of security to ensure that a breach in one area does not result in a total failure of data security.
